# **TowardsAGI Concept Mini Website**

## Overview

This project is a concept website for TowardsAGI, a thought leadership platform focused on inspiring, educating, and supporting businesses and individuals in Generative AI (GenAI) and Service as a Software (SaaS) transformations. 
I've included two elements:
A. A splash page to promote the “3rd Edition of Gen Matrix report”
B. A responsive, accessible landing page to engage tech leaders.

## Brand

TowardsAGI inspires and educates tech leaders and businesses on GenAI and SaaS transitions, positioning itself as a trusted authority. The brand is professional, forward-thinking, innovative, and approachable, with a mission to provide actionable insights for transformative technologies.

## Brand Guidelines

I used https://www.brandextractor.com/dashboard/towardsagi.ai?url=TOWARDSAGI.AI#colors to identify the palette currently used by the website and chose a few of them as the basis

## Colours

Primary (headers, buttons, jump out points): Inspired by the logo Purple is dominant: 
Deep Purple (#6F2F9F)
Light Purple (#9B51E0)

Secondary (text, backgrounds and anything that isn't blending)
Bright Blue (#2EA3F2)
Dark Blue (#006799)
Light Gray (#DFE3EB)
Red (#CF2E2E)
Off-White (#F7F7F7)
Dark Gray (#333333)

## Backgrounds:

White (#FFFFFF)
Light Gray (#D1D5DB)

## Font: 
Sans-serif
two variations as the original website has multiple and can be confusing.

## Logo: A stylized neural network with forward arrows (TowardsAGI_logo.webp).


# Design Principles

1. Hierarchy: The splash page always shows but the see through element retains attention even if the splash message doesn't apply.

2. Contrast: Purple/blue objects on white/gray backgrounds ensure readability and visual appeal.

3. Alignment: Grid for the main layout and Flexbox for browsing and splash page  flexible/adapts to viewport

4. Whitespace: Spacious feeling

5. Repetition: Consistent use of colours, fonts, and styles reinforces TowardsAGI’s serious appearance.
