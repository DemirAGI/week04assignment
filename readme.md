TowardsAGI Concept Mini Website

Overview

This project is a concept website for TowardsAGI, a thought leadership platform focused on inspiring, educating, and supporting businesses and individuals in Generative AI (GenAI) and Service as a Software (SaaS) transformations. 
I've included two elements:
A. A splash page to promote the “3rd Edition of Gen Matrix report”
B. A responsive, accessible landing page to engage tech leaders.

Brand

TowardsAGI inspires and educates tech leaders and businesses on GenAI and SaaS transitions, positioning itself as a trusted authority. The brand is professional, forward-thinking, innovative, and approachable, with a mission to provide actionable insights for transformative technologies.

Brand Guidelines

I used https://www.brandextractor.com/dashboard/towardsagi.ai?url=TOWARDSAGI.AI#colors to identify the palette currently used by the website and chose a few of them as the basis

Colours

Primary (headers, buttons, jump out points): Inspired by the logo Purple is dominant: 
Deep Purple (#6F2F9F)
Light Purple (#9B51E0)

Secondary (text, backgrounds and anything that isn't blending)
Bright Blue (#2EA3F2)
Dark Blue (#006799)
Light Gray (#DFE3EB)
Red (#CF2E2E)
Off-White (#F7F7F7)
Dark Gray (#333333)

Backgrounds:

White (#FFFFFF)
Light Gray (#D1D5DB)



Font: 
Sans-serif
two variations as the original website has multiple and can be confusing.

Logo: A stylized neural network with forward arrows (TowardsAGI_logo.webp).


Design Principles

Hierarchy: The splash page always shows but the see through element retains attention even if the splash message doesn't apply.

Contrast: Purple/blue objects on white/gray backgrounds ensure readability and visual appeal.

Alignment: Grid for the main layout and Flexbox for browsing and splash page  flexible/adapts to viewport

Whitespace: Spacious feeling

Repetition: Consistent use of colours, fonts, and styles reinforces TowardsAGI’s serious appearance.

Customer Personas

Persona 1: Alex Chen
Age: 40
Occupation: Head of APIs in a mid to large enterprise
Goals: Ensure APIs are under control, manage integration budgets effectively.
Pain Points:
Difficulty integrating legacy systems with GenAI and SaaS platforms.
Budget constraints for adopting new API management tools.
Lack of expertise in evaluating AI-driven API solutions.
Complexity in securely managing multiple API endpoints.

Value Prop: Offers guidance on SaaS transitions for streamlined API management, resources on Multi-Cloud Platforms (MCPs), and insights to optimize integration budgets.

Persona 2: Carlos Alberto
Age: 40
Occupation: Business Unit Director
Goals: Achieve ROI from AI projects, remain competitive and feasible.
Pain Points:
High ROI expectations for AI projects not met, with no clear value seen.
Difficulty aligning AI initiatives with business objectives.
Lack of clarity in working with System Integrators (SIs) and consultancy partners.
Risk of falling behind competitors due to slow SaaS/AI adoption.

Value Prop: Provides strategic SaaS transition guidance, advises on collaborating with SIs and partners, and offers thought leadership to maximize AI ROI.

Requirements

Branding: Consistent use of primary colors (#6F2F9F, #9B51E0), Montserrat/Inter fonts, and tech-inspired imagery align with TowardsAGI’s innovative identity.

Design Principles: Hierarchy, contrast, alignment, whitespace, and repetition create a clear, engaging user experience.
Responsive Design: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and a media query (768px breakpoint) ensure usability on mobile and desktop devices.

Media Query: Adjusts splash page size, font sizes, navigation, and resource grid for smaller screens.



Accessibility: Alt text for all images and ARIA labels for buttons enhance screen reader compatibility.



Splash Page: Centered, minimum 400px x 400px or 40% of viewport, with a header (“Have you read the 3rd Edition of Gen Matrix report?”), a “Download” button, and an “X” close button.



Stretch Goals:





Interactivity: JavaScript enables a splash page close function and a hero section image toggle (AI neural network to SaaS dashboard) with updated alt text and ARIA labels.



Customer Personas: Two personas (Alex and Carlos) applied to tailor content for tech leaders and business directors.



Accessibility Enhancements: ARIA labels and high-contrast design improve usability for screen readers.

Challenges





Logo Integration: Without access to TowardsAGI_logo.webp, a placeholder was used. In a real project, the custom logo would strengthen brand identity.



Image Sourcing: Finding free, high-quality AI/SaaS images was challenging; placeholders were used. Licensed stock images would enhance authenticity.



Balancing Colors: Using multiple secondary colors (#2EA3F2, #006799, etc.) required careful application to avoid visual clutter while maintaining brand coherence.

Why This Landing Page Is Better Than a Splash Page

Unlike a basic splash page, which serves as a brief teaser (e.g., the Week 01 announcement page), this landing page:





Drives conversions with a clear CTA (“Download Guide”) tied to the splash page’s “Download” theme.



Provides detailed content about TowardsAGI’s mission, resources, and value proposition.



Ensures responsiveness across devices with a media query and flexible layouts.



Enhances engagement with interactivity (splash page close, image toggle).



Reinforces branding through consistent colors, fonts, and imagery, creating a professional, cohesive experience.



Incorporates accessibility features (alt text, ARIA labels) for inclusivity.
